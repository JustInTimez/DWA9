Dynamic Web Apps 9 Challenge

## Description
In this module, you will be required to use the Shoelace component library in a brand-new JavaScript project and build the original Tally App example from the very first lesson using only Shoelace components. You will be provided with three user stories that should be met at a minimum, however, you are encouraged to add additional functionality. You are free to choose the components you think are best suited to meet these user stories.
