# DWA9
Dynamic Web Apps 9 Challenge

## Description
In this module, I am required to use the Shoelace component library in a brand-new JavaScript project and build the original Tally App example from the very first lesson using only Shoelace components. I have been provided with three user stories that should be met at a minimum, however, I am encouraged to add additional functionality. I am free to choose the components I think are best suited to meet these user stories.

## User Stories (Gherkin syntax)

### SCENARIO 1: Increment the counter by one
- GIVEN the tally counter app is open - [ ]
- AND the counter is at 0
- WHEN I click the "Add" button
- THEN the counter should display 1

### SCENARIO 2: Decrement the counter by one
- GIVEN the tally counter app is open
- AND the counter is at 1
- WHEN I click the "Subtract" button
- THEN the counter should display 0

### SCENARIO 3: Resetting the Tally Counter
- GIVEN the tally counter app is open
- AND the counter value is 10
- WHEN I click on the "Reset" button
- THEN the counter value should change to 0
- AND a confirmation message should be displayed that the counter has been reset
